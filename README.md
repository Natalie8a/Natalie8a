💻 Full-Stack developer in the making 🤓 | Polyglot 🗣️ (6 spoken languages🌍) | Recovering perfectionist💯 (trying to find the ✨perfect✨😉 balance between *unrealistically ideal right now* and: done, works, looks good, and could *later* be improved if need be). Oh, I also have a master's degree in philosophy btw 😊.
