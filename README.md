💻 Full-Stack developer in the making 🤓 | Polyglot 🗣️ (6 spoken languages🌍) | Recovering perfectionnist💯 (trying to find the ✨perfect✨😉 balance between *unrealistically ideal right now* and: done, works, looks good, and could *later* be improved if need be). Oh, I also have a master's degree in philosophy btw 😊.

# What I've done so far

Well, I created [this](https://www.notion.so/Naty-s-Dev-Dashboard-1e511538cbc480d3889fc71831217a2b) Notion page to keep track of things. It's still a work in progress in itself.

## What I'm up to

 - Diving deeper into React so that I can turn the simple Random Excuse Generator, that I created as a 4GeekAcademy mini-project, into a much more complex and customizable one.
 - I'm planning on creating the website for a restaurant that doesn't have one yet... But I'm brainstorming and starting before actually offering this to them. If they're not interested, I'll just do a fictional restaurant website.
 - And well, I guess it goes without saying, I'm following the bootcamp and doing those required readings and projects.

## Dev toolkit

- 🛠️ current stack: JavaScript, Rreact, HTML, CSS, Git, Bootstrap
- 🌱🎯 learning (with4Geeks+on my own): Further React, Tailwind

## Fun Facts About Me⚡ 
- ⚙️ My favorite subject in Philosophy was Logic. One time, doing a Logic homework at my then student residence, a friend in tech was passing by and said something like "Oh, that actually looks like something I'd do for my classes!"... Whence my curiosity for web development spawned 🐣
- 🌍 Amongst my 6 spoken anguages:
	 -  🇨🇴🇫🇷🇺🇸3 are at native to near-native level
	-  🇸🇪Only 1 I fully learned on Duolingo🦉
		-  🙈And I have played with 18 languages on Duolingo just for fun, without any intent on actually learning them 😇
